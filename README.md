## Requirements

Download and install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

Download and install [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/)

Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

Create a new virtual environment

`$ conda create --name polyenv python=3.8`

Activate the new virtual environment

`$ conda activate polyenv`

Install packages

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

Alternatively, you can take a look at the requirements.txt file and install what you need.

Note, I'm using VS Code with the ipykernel (Jupyter Notebook) capability to run in a notebook like experience.  You can certainly also run this without this.
